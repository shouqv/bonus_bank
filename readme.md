# Bank System Project (Updated)


## Description

This project implements a banking system in Python, allowing cashiers to manage customer accounts stored in a CSV file. It leverages file handling, exception handling, and is developed following a test-driven development (TDD) approach.

The system supports functionalities including:
- Adding new customers
- Depositing and withdrawing money
- Transferring funds between accounts, including to other customers' accounts
- Overdraft protection with rules and account reactivation
Custom exceptions to handle invalid inputs and errors (e.g., invalid options, incorrect IDs, empty files, invalid numeric values, inactive accounts, overdraft-related errors, etc.)
- Transaction history with detailed logging and indexing
- Password strength validation for secure customer accounts
- Custom overdraft limits with account deactivation rules
- Automated account statement reports (.txt format)
- Random bonus system for lowest balances


## Features
- **Add New Customer**  
  - Can create a checking account, savings account, both, or neither  
  - Account ID is automatically generated 
  - Now includes password strength validation.


- **Withdraw Money** (requires login)  
  - From checking or savings accounts  
  - Checking accounts adhere to overdraft rules  
  - Savings accounts do not allow overdrafts  

- **Deposit Money** (requires login)  
  - Into checking or savings accounts  

- **Transfer Money** (requires login)  
  - Between own accounts  
  - To other customers’ accounts  

- **Overdraft Protection**  
  - $35 fee for overdraft  
  - Prevents account balance from going below a set limit (default -100 or custom per customer).
  - Account deactivation after 2 successful overdrafts  
  - Reactivation after clearing overdraft and fees  

- **Transaction History**
  - All customer operations are stored in transaction.csv.
  - Can list all transactions for a customer.
  - View detailed information about a single transaction.
  - Displays timestamp, type of operation, and resulting balance.

- **Account Statement Report**
  - Generates a text report (```customer{account_id}_statement.txt```).
  - Includes balances and customer's transactions.

- **Top 3 Customer Reward**
  - Identifies the three customers with the lowest combined balances.
  - Randomly selects one to receive a $100 bonus in their checking account.
  - Outputs all three customers and the winner’s information (name + ID) to the terminal.

- **Exception Handling & Custom Exceptions**
  - Provides robust error handling for all user inputs and banking operations.  
  - Ensures the application can handle errors gracefully without crashing.  
  - Includes **custom domain-specific exceptions**:  
    - **InactiveAccountError**: Raised when attempting to operate on an inactive account.  
    - **AccountIsNoneError**: Raised when accessing an account that was not created.  
    - **OverdraftRejectedError**: Raised when an overdraft attempt is invalid (e.g., on a savings account or exceeding allowed amount limits).  
    - **OverdraftLimitExceededError**: Raised when overdraft attempts exceed allowed count.  
    - **CustomerNotFoundError**: Raised when a non-existent customer ID is used.  
    - **InvalidChoiceError**: Raised when the user selects an invalid menu option or account type.  
  - Handles **built-in Python exceptions** with custom messages for clarity:  
    - **ValueError**: Raised for invalid numeric inputs (e.g., non-numeric deposits/withdrawals).  
  - Some exceptions allow **recovery actions**:  
    - Prompting users to create a missing account (`AccountIsNoneError`).  
    - Preventing transfers to invalid accounts while guiding the user to valid options.  
  - Helps maintain **data integrity** and ensures **realistic banking rules** are enforced consistently across all operations.

# What I Learned

- How to design and implement a project using Test-Driven Development (TDD) from the ground up.

- The importance of modularity, by separating concerns into classes (Customer, CheckingAccount, SavingAccount, FileManagement, Transaction).

- How to implement custom exceptions to handle domain-specific errors gracefully.

- Practical experience with file I/O, CSV data persistence, and input validation.

- Building a CLI banking system that feels close to real-world workflows.

- Extending core functionality with security features (password validation), data tracking (transaction history), reporting (account statements), and reward logic (top 3 customer system).
